  <h1>The Major-General's Song</h1>
  <h2>Gilbert & Sullivan (1879)</h2>
  <p>I am the very model of a modern Major-General,
    I've information vegetable, animal, and mineral,
    I know the kings of England, and I quote the fights historical,
    From Marathon to Waterloo, in order categorical;
    I'm very well acquainted too with matters mathematical,
    I understand equations, both the simple and quadratical,
    About binomial theorem I'm teeming with a lot o' news--- 
    With many cheerful facts about the square of the hypotenuse.</p>
  
  <p>I'm very good at integral and differential calculus;</p>
    <p>I know the scientific names of beings animalculous:</p>
    <p>In short, in matters vegetable, animal, and mineral,</p>
    <p>I am the very model of a modern Major-General.</p>
    <p>I know our mythic history, King Arthur's and Sir Caradoc's;</p>
    <p>I answer hard acrostics, I've a pretty taste for paradox,</p>
    <p>I quote in elegiacs all the crimes of Heliogabalus,</p>
    <p>In conics I can floor peculiarities parabolous;</p>
    <p>I can tell undoubted Raphaels from Gerard Dows and Zoffanies,</p>
    <p>I know the croaking chorus from The Frogs of Aristophanes!</p>
    <p>Then I can hum a fugue of which I've heard the music's din afore,</p>
    <p>And whistle all the airs from that infernal nonsense Pinafore.</p>
    <p>Then I can write a washing bill in Babylonic cuneiform,</p>
    <p>And tell you ev'ry detail of Caractacus's uniform:</p>
    <p>In short, in matters vegetable, animal, and mineral,</p>
    <p>I am the very model of a modern Major-General.</p>
    <p>In fact, when I know what is meant by "mamelon" and "ravelin",</p>
    <p>When I can tell at sight a Mauser rifle from a javelin,</p>
    <p>When such affairs as sorties and surprises I'm more wary at,</p>
    <p>And when I know precisely what is meant by "commissariat",</p>
    <p>When I have learnt what progress has been made in modern gunnery,</p>
    <p>When I know more of tactics than a novice in a nunnery –</p>
    <p>In short, when I've a smattering of elemental strategy –</p>
    <p>You'll say a better Major-General has never sat a gee.</p>
    <p>For my military knowledge, though I'm plucky and adventury,</p>
    <p>Has only been brought down to the beginning of the century;</p>
    <p>But still, in matters vegetable, animal, and mineral,</p>
    <p>I am the very model of a modern Major-General.</p>
